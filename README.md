This code is for the paper `Matched Case-Control Data with a Misclassified Exposure: What
can be done with Instrumental Variables?' by C MANUEL, S SINHA,  AND S WANG.
Here we are proving two files, 1) where we have a single matching variable, single prognostic factor, and a single instrumental variable, and the file name is simulation_GTHB.R and b) where we have mutiple matching variables, single prognostic factor, and multiple instrumental variable, and the file name is simulation_alpha0_eq_0_GTHB.R. We want to point out that in the second file, we set alpha0=0 in the analysis.
